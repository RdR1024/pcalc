If there was a second shooter, then in all likelihood (95%) the forensic evidence of the bullet trajectory would indicate that\".  Based on this statement, what is the probability that there was a second shooter?\n\n\n\n\nThe figure above shows the problem as a diagram.  We have two variables \"TrajectoryEvidence\" and \"SecondShooter\", both of which are the usual probability variables (i.e. they can be true or false to a degree).  We also have an arrow which represents \"...would indicate that\". This situation, where variables are linked is called a \nconditional probability\n.  We can write it with probability statements as follows:\n\n\n\n\nThe probability of SecondShooter is 40%\n\n\nThe probability of TrajectoryEvidence given SecondShooter is 95%\n\n\n\n\nNote that the second sentence does \nnot\n say that the probability of the TrajectoryEvidence \nis\n 95%. It says that \nif\n SecondShooter is true \nthen\n the probability that we'll see it in the TrajectoryEvidence is  95%.\n\n\nOnce we have stated the known probabilities and conditional probabilities, we can calculate the probability in question the usual way.  For example, what is our prediction that we'll get positive trajectory evidence?\n\n\n\n\nThe probability of the trajectory evidence is: probability of TrajectoryEvidence\n\n\n\n\nLet's try another example.  Let's say that if it rained then there is some chance (80%) that we see wet grass (there is a small chance that maybe it dried already). And, there is a 20% chance that it rained.\n\n\n\n\nThe probability statements that capture this situation:\n\n\n\n\nprobability of  Rained is 20%\n\n\nprobability of  Wetgrass given Rained is 80%\n\n\n\n\nBased on the supplied information, the probability that we will see wetgrass is percent prob Wetgrass%.\n\n\n\n\nShortcut\n\n\nMostly we want to see the probability results as percentages.  An easy way to do this, is to put the keyword \"percent\" in front of your probability formula. It calculates the result as a whole percentage (no decimal places). Have a look at the formula just above that calculates the probability of Wetgrass. For an even shorter cut, use \"%\" instead of \"percent\".  So: `% prob Wetgrass` = %prob Wetgrass.\n\n\nAlso, sometimes you want only the result of a formula, but sometimes you want the formula \nand\n the result.  A shortcut for that is to put a question mark at the end of the formula (inside the backticks).  That will keep the formula and the result. Like this:\n\n\n\\`%prob WetGrass?\\`\n\n\n\n\n\nOften, we're given information (probabilities and conditional probabilities) that flows in one direction, but our question is really about the reverse direction.  For example, maybe we come home, see the grass is wet, and want to know what the probability is that it rained.  We can simply formulate that as a probability statement:\n\n\n\n\npercent prob Rained given Wetgrass\n\n\n\n\nThere is a very good reason that there is a 100% probability that it rained, if we observe WetGrass. Namely, in this particular problem statement, there is only one way that the grass \ncould\n be wet -- and that is if it rained.  This type of \"reverse\" calculation gets more complicated in problems with multiple variables, which we'll look at in the next section.\n\n\nExercises (3)\n\n\nAssume that in the desert the following is the case. There is a 25% chance that your engine will overheat.  If the engine overheats, it is very likely (85%) that the overheating indicator will light up on your dashboard. \n\n\n\n\nShow the probability variables and relationship a diagram\n\n\nHow can the given information be captured as probability statements?\n\n\nWhat is the probability that the \"overheating\" indicator light will go on?\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \nType your formulas below (don't forget the backticks)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \nactivate_ckeditor(\"editor1\",\"CalcButton\");",

We have two variables \"TrajectoryEvidence\" and \"SecondShooter\", both of which are the usual probability variables (i.e. they can be true or false to a degree).  We also have an arrow which represents \"...would indicate that\". This situation, where variables are linked is called a  conditional probability .  We can write it with probability statements as follows:   The probability of SecondShooter is 40%  The probability of TrajectoryEvidence given SecondShooter is 95%   Note that the second sentence does  not  say that the probability of the TrajectoryEvidence  is  95%. It says that  if  SecondShooter is true  then  the probability that we'll see it in the TrajectoryEvidence is  95%.  Once we have stated the known probabilities and conditional probabilities, we can calculate the probability in question the usual way.  For example, what is our prediction that we'll get positive trajectory evidence?   The probability of the trajectory evidence is: probability of TrajectoryEvidence   Let's try another example.  Let's say that if it rained then there is some chance (80%) that we see wet grass (there is a small chance that maybe it dried already). And, there is a 20% chance that it rained.   The probability statements that capture this situation:   probability of  Rained is 20%  probability of  Wetgrass given Rained is 80%   Based on the supplied information, the probability that we will see wetgrass is percent prob Wetgrass%.   Shortcut  Mostly we want to see the probability results as percentages.  An easy way to do this, is to put the keyword \"percent\" in front of your probability formula. It calculates the result as a whole percentage (no decimal places). Have a look at the formula just above that calculates the probability of Wetgrass. For an even shorter cut, use \"%\" instead of \"percent\".  So: `% prob Wetgrass` = %prob Wetgrass.  Also, sometimes you want only the result of a formula, but sometimes you want the formula  and  the result.  A shortcut for that is to put a question mark at the end of the formula (inside the backticks).  That will keep the formula and the result. Like this:  \\`%prob WetGrass?\\`   Often, we're given information (probabilities and conditional probabilities) that flows in one direction, but our question is really about the reverse direction.  For example, maybe we come home, see the grass is wet, and want to know what the probability is that it rained.  We can simply formulate that as a probability statement:   percent prob Rained given Wetgrass   There is a very good reason that there is a 100% probability that it rained, if we observe WetGrass. Namely, in this particular problem statement, there is only one way that the grass  could  be wet -- and that is if it rained.  This type of \"reverse\" calculation gets more complicated in problems with multiple variables, which we'll look at in the next section.",

            "text": "We use Probability Calculator to solve the \nSWARM Firefox problem\n.  First we will re-state the problem here so the page is self-contained.\n\n\nProblem Description\n\n\nPreface\n\n\nIn the (\nmediocre\n) 1982 movie \u201cFirefox\u201d (based on the \ndecent\n 1977 thriller), US pilot Mitchell Gant steals the Firefox, a fictional top secret supersonic stealth aircraft developed by the Soviet Union.  He initially heads south ensuring he is seen by a commercial airliner before using the stealth properties of the plane to turn north unseen. His plan is to follow the Ural mountains to a clever refueling rendezvous before heading west. Here is our adaptation.\n\n\nThe Problem\n\n\nImagine you are the Soviet general in charge of the northern defenses.  You know Gant was last seen heading south. However, your top analyst says Gant is trained in evasion, and suspects it was a diversion and that he is heading north. Here we will depart from the movie a bit to make an interesting but tractable decision problem.\n\n\nGant has to go either north or south. You judge there is a 50% chance Gant went north, probably following the Ural mountains. Your team estimates it is three times as likely he is flying at low altitude than at high (i.e. odds are 3:1 in favor of low).\n\n\nYou have two detection systems.\n\n\nAcoustic detectors\n, known as \u201c\nBig Ears\n.\u201d These can detect a supersonic aircraft by picking up the sonic boom. Big Ears detects 95% of low-altitude supersonic targets, and 50% of high-altitude targets. It is unlikely any other aircraft would set them off right now, so there is only a 1% false alarm rate.\n\n\nRadar\n. You know this radar works poorly against a target like Firefox. At best it has a 30% detection, when Firefox is up high presenting a broad target on a clear background. At low altitudes, detection is only 10%.  There is always a 5% false alarm rate, including both system noise, other aircraft, and occasional bird flocks.\n\n\nThe sensors are been linked by a simple rules-based system made for\ndetecting possible NATO stealth test flights in the north (the south\nis someone else\u2019s problem):\n\n\n\n\nIf Radar reports no contact, and BigEars report a supersonic footprint, say \u201cStealth\u201d.\n\n\nOtherwise, say \u201cNo Stealth\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nYour top analyst warns that this system was not designed for stealth as good as Firefox. There is little time to recalibrate for its overly conservative rules, so she intuitively adjusts:\n\n\n\n\nIf the system says \u201cStealth\u201d she will say \u201cFirefox\u201d. \n\n\nElse if the radar reports a contact, she will most likely (75%) say that it is \u201cFirefox.\u201d \n\n\nOtherwise, she is only 20% likely to say \u201cFirefox\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\nYour analyst says \u201cNot Firefox\u201d.  What is the chance Gant was nevertheless in the north? Compare that with taking a non-stealth reading straight from the rules system?\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nGant knows he is taking the northern route.

He initially heads south ensuring he is seen by a commercial airliner before using the stealth properties of the plane to turn north unseen. His plan is to follow the Ural mountains to a clever refueling rendezvous before heading west. Here is our adaptation.",

            "text": "Imagine you are the Soviet general in charge of the northern defenses.  You know Gant was last seen heading south. However, your top analyst says Gant is trained in evasion, and suspects it was a diversion and that he is heading north. Here we will depart from the movie a bit to make an interesting but tractable decision problem.  Gant has to go either north or south. You judge there is a 50% chance Gant went north, probably following the Ural mountains. Your team estimates it is three times as likely he is flying at low altitude than at high (i.e. odds are 3:1 in favor of low).  You have two detection systems.  Acoustic detectors , known as \u201c Big Ears .\u201d These can detect a supersonic aircraft by picking up the sonic boom. Big Ears detects 95% of low-altitude supersonic targets, and 50% of high-altitude targets. It is unlikely any other aircraft would set them off right now, so there is only a 1% false alarm rate.  Radar . You know this radar works poorly against a target like Firefox. At best it has a 30% detection, when Firefox is up high presenting a broad target on a clear background. At low altitudes, detection is only 10%.  There is always a 5% false alarm rate, including both system noise, other aircraft, and occasional bird flocks.  The sensors are been linked by a simple rules-based system made for\ndetecting possible NATO stealth test flights in the north (the south\nis someone else\u2019s problem):   If Radar reports no contact, and BigEars report a supersonic footprint, say \u201cStealth\u201d.  Otherwise, say \u201cNo Stealth\u201d.   Your top analyst warns that this system was not designed for stealth as good as Firefox. There is little time to recalibrate for its overly conservative rules, so she intuitively adjusts:   If the system says \u201cStealth\u201d she will say \u201cFirefox\u201d.   Else if the radar reports a contact, she will most likely (75%) say that it is \u201cFirefox.\u201d   Otherwise, she is only 20% likely to say \u201cFirefox\u201d.",

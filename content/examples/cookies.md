# Cookie Jar Example

This is a simple evidence chain, showing the effect of indirect
reporting. 

> In pre-school, Alice reports that Bob says that Charlie took some cookies from the jar. About â…“ of such reports are true. Bob is ~90% likely to report cookie snatches, and ~15% likely to make a false alarm. Alice is about 70% likely to relay a theft report and about 40% likely to mis-convey a non-theft report. Did Charlie steal cookies?

Note that you have only second-hand information. You do not
know what Bob actually said, only what Alice reports. You need to
construct an _evidence chain_ to model the overall reliability of the
system.

We make the assumption that in such situations Bob reports _something_
that Charlie did, otherwise the probabilities seem rather high that
Alice would spontaneously report a cookie theft. Work with us here.

## Discussion
Evidence chains generally dilute the evidence. Bob is a reliable
reporter, but we have to multiply probabilities down the chain. Now,
we need only consider worlds where AliceReports. But there are still four
cases to consider: CharlieTook or not, and BobTells or not. 

In 1000 cases:

* CharlieTook in 333
    * BobTells in 300, of which AliceReports **210**
    * not BobTells in 33, of which AliceReports **13**
* not CharlieTook in 666
    * BobTells in 100, of which AliceReports **70**
    * not BobTells in 566, of which AliceReports **226**

Of the (210 + 13 + 70 + 226 = **519**) cases where AliceReports, 210 are
correct. 210/519 = 40%.

(This is one reason that legal proceedings make such a big deal about
the chain of custody of the evidence.)

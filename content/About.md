# About this calculator

The idea for this calculator originated in the University of Melbourne's [SWARM project](https://www.swarmproject.info/).  In that project, we developed a platform for groups of people to collaborate on analytical reasoning -- in particular as related to _intelligence analysis_.  As part of the design, we looked for easier ways to deal with probability calculations.

# Using the calculator

To use the calculator, you type a formula between _backticks_.  The backtick is a kind of backward leaning single quote.  Typically, the backtick key is located in the top left corner of your keyboard.

For example, you can type the calculation 1+2*3, like so: \`1+2\*3\`

Depending on the implementation of the text editor, the formula is calculated when you click outside the editor (like in the menu bar), or when you click the **calculate** button (somewhere near the editor or in the menubar).

The calculator can do basic arithmetic like (1+2)^2 / 3.   You can also use the keyword _round_ in front of a calculation, like \`round 3.33333\`, which rounds to whole number.  And you can use the keyword _percent_ in front of a calculation, like \`percent 0.05\`, which will multiply by 100 and round.

The calculator will do simple arithmetic, but it's main purpose is to help with probability calculations. Read on to see how that works.
